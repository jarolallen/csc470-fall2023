# Final Project: A Complete Game with a Theme

# Final Project Due Dates
## Design Document (20%)
### Due 12/1/23
Your design document should include:

A detailed plan for the game. This will involve describing all of the following components:
- Gameplay description: 					
Expansion of units project into actual game. NPC enemies that attack units and player's base. Game over if player's base loses all hp. Player can create attack units with resources. Player wins if attack units destroys enemy base.

- Input:
WASD, mouse buttons, spacebar, (mouse hover direction?)

- Visual style:
Medival fantasy characters / monsters / player village 

- Audio style:
Fantasy / magic

- Interface sketches:

- Story/theme description:
Build up your forces and destroy the demon king's castle

Three feature set targets:
- the “low-bar “of you will create (this should still be a “complete game”)
Figure out how to convicingly chase other objects without input. UI shows all expected feature. Can win game by depleting enemy base hp. Can lose by attackers taking player base hp.

- a target that you expect to get done:
Make interesting enviorments, models, animations, sounds, differnt types of things to gather with diffent values

- a desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well. Plan these out carefully, so that you can definitely achieve the first goal, and likely hit the second:
more complex health and damage system for units and bases, different resources?, 


-Timeline
-Dec 8th:
Meet low-bar. Basic ideas for controlling all units should be coded. Maybe graphics / audio implmented

-Dec 12th: 
Should be a satisfactory game at this point

-Dec 15th:
Try out some experiments and improvements. Maybe a difference between metal / wood resources.
