# Story/theme description:
-Build up your forces and destroy the demon king's castle


# The “low-bar “of you will create (this should still be a “complete game”)
-Figure out how to convicingly chase other objects without input. UI shows all expected feature. Can win game by depleting enemy base hp. Can lose by attackers taking player base hp.

# Target that you expect to get done
-Make interesting enviorments, models, animations, sounds, differnt types of things to gather with diffent values

# A desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well. Plan these out carefully, so that you can definitely achieve the first goal, and likely hit the second:
-more complex health and damage system for units and bases, different resources?, 


# Dec 8th:
-Meet low-bar. Basic ideas for controlling all units should be coded. Maybe graphics / audio implmented

# Dec 12th: 
-Should be a satisfactory game at this point

# Dec 15th:
-Try out some experiments and improvements. Maybe a difference between metal / wood resources.
