# Final Project: A Complete Game with a Theme

# Final Project Due Dates
## Design Document (20%)
### Due 12/1/23
Your design document should include:

A detailed plan for the game. This will involve describing all of the following components:
- Gameplay description 					
Expansion of units project into actual game. NPC enemies that attack units and player's base. Game over if player's base loses all hp. Player can create attack units with resources. Player wins if attack units destroys enemy base.

- Input
WASD, mouse buttons, spacebar, (mouse hover direction?)

- Visual style
Medival fantasy characters / monsters / player village 

- Audio style
Fantasy / magic

- Interface sketches

- Story/theme description
Build up your forces and destroy the demon king's castle

Three feature set targets:
- the “low-bar “of you will create (this should still be a “complete game”)
Figure out how to convicingly chase other objects without input. UI shows all expected feature. Can win game by depleting enemy base hp. Can lose by attackers taking player base hp.

- a target that you expect to get done
Make interesting enviorments, models, animations, sounds, differnt types of things to gather with diffent values

- a desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well. Plan these out carefully, so that you can definitely achieve the first goal, and likely hit the second
more complex health and damage system for units and bases, different resources?, 


-Timeline
Dec 8th
Meet low-bar. Basic ideas for controlling all units should be coded. Maybe graphics / audio implmented

Dec 12th 
Should be a satisfactory game at this point

Dec 15th
Try out some experiments and improvements. Maybe a difference between metal / wood resources.



Be sure to spend time on this. The document should be approximately "2-3 pages", and you should **include it in a README.md file in your your project directory named 'final'**.

You should see your design document when you go to:

## Check ins each class (20%)
Each class I will check in with you and assess your progress on your project. Note that these assessments are worth 20% of your grade!

## Core Mechanic Playtesting (20%)
### Due 12/8/23
At this point, the core mechanic of your game should be mostly complete.

Before class, create a WebGL build of your game that demonstrates what you have working and post it to github. In class, we will discuss areas that you should spend time improving, including bugs, and gameplay features.

## Final Submission (40%)
### Due 12/15/23
Submit a WebGL build of your game, as well as all of the project files to your GitHub repository.

Additionally, create one or more of the following and submit it along with your project files to your GitHub repository:

- A “one pager” where you put a description of your game and some representative screenshots (think of it like an ad for your game)
- A simple trailer that shows gameplay
- A simple website that describes your game with images

# Submission

Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "final"
and located in the "games" folder of your local github repository. To push it up to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen), and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.

If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:
```
  http://(your git username).github.io/csc470-fall2023/games/final/
```
If exporting your game to WebGL doesn't work, build your game for either Mac or  and attempt to upload that to GitHub in your Assets folder. If your game is too large to upload, include a file to a link to download the game (you can just put it on Google Drive, Dropbox, or some other such platform).
